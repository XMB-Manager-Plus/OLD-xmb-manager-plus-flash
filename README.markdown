XMB Manager Plus Flash Mod
==========================

XMB Manager Plus (XMBM+) Flash Mod is a application that allow the flash to serach for XMB Manager Plus in the /dev_hdd0/game/XMBMANPLS directory.

It changes dev_flash xml and rco files so the xmb can read the XMB Manager Plus directory.

Since this is a adaptation of Rebug Package Manager Installer all credits go to the Rebug Team for the installer.
And other credit go to the Team XMBM+ for modding and addapt RCO files
